A Doodle Jump Game - Our COMP-127 Project

by Christopher, Hareth, and Sheeraj

This project contains all of the necessary code & graphics 
for running and playing a Doodle Jump-like game, 
where you have a character continuously jump 
from platform to platform to get as high up as you possibly can.

This project only requires having Java 17 installed for GUI objects to function properly. 
To start a new session, run the 'DoodleJump.java' class in order to begin playing. 
To move the character, use the left and right arrow keys, or the 'A & 'D' keys.

All code and art assets used in here are original, and were solely created by us. 
We did not use any outside help or references for this project.

Something to note is that any high scores achieved will carry over between games of the same session,
but those scores will not be kept if you exit out of the game and start a new session.
In addition, we noticed that on rare occasions the game will freeze. 
We are unsure as to why this happens, although we believe it may involve how the platforms are generated onto the game window.

Since this game relies solely on visual feedback and gameplay,
blind people or people with severe visibility issues would be unable to play.
Also, since controlling the character relies on using the keyboard,
those that have to use assistive devices in place of a keyboard may have difficulties as well.
However, we did make some adjustments to our game to be more inclusive to various players
For example, for people with visibility issues, the background, character, and platform colors
were altered such that they can be distinguished from one another, and black outlines were 
placed around the character and platforms to make them more visible against the background.
In addition, for those that may have trouble controlling the character with their right hand,
the 'A' and 'D' keys are also able to move the character left and right. 
From that, it now allows for those who prefer playing with their left hand to
control the character in a more natural positonn on the keyboard.
